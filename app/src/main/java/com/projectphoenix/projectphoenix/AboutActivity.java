The idea for the system originated in the wake of the 2017 California wildfire season, which is the most destructive wildfire season on record, with nearly 10,000 structures completely destroyed. We wanted to create a system that would allow families to protect their homes immediately, no matter where they are.";

We also reached out to the City of Corona Fire Department, as well as to local hardware stores for data and measurements in regard to fires and how to prevent and suppress them. From these sources we gathered vital information allowing us to create an optimal sprinkler system. The aid weâ€™ve received from our community is immeasurable.";
